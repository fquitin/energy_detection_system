The Energy Detection System folder includes these parts:

- FPGA -> source verilog code of implemented module, ipcores for implemented modules, FPGA images synthesized, utility to flash the FPGA and synthesize the image

- Host_programs -> different programs to use the implemented images

- Matlab -> some script useful to read the samples stored and to compare the simulated results.
